# Flower-Type-Classification Model
This Machine Learning model was designed using the Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes Algorithm because of its speed and has no hyper-parameters to choose. 
The classification report of the algorithm shows that the model has a 98% precision and 97% accuracy in its prediction of the flower types amongst one of the following types 
1.	Iris-Setosa
2.	Iris-Versicolor
3.	Iris-Virginica


# The dataset contains 150 training sets with 4 attributes (i.e. Sepal Width, Sepal Length, Petal Width, Petal Length)

_The CBF.png file shows a graphical representation of the correlation between the features_ 
_The GOTVVPV.png file shows a graph of the true value versus predicted values_
The algorithm predicts with a 97% accuracy (F1 Score)
